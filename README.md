# C Piscine Rush 02

## Overview
This project is part of the C Piscine @ 42 curriculum. The goal is to create a program that converts numbers into their written form using a dictionary.

## Key Features
- Converts a numeric value into its written text form.
- Supports up to 2 arguments: a number and an optional custom dictionary.
- Handles large numbers beyond unsigned int.
- Outputs error messages for invalid input or dictionary issues.

## Compilation
Use the following commands to compile:

The program must compile with these flags: `-Wall -Wextra -Werror`

## Usage
1. **Single Argument**: Converts the given number.
   
Output: `forty two`

3. **Two Arguments**: Uses a custom dictionary and converts the number.


- For invalid input, it outputs `"Error"` or `"Dict Error"`.

## Bonus Features
- Use hyphens and commas for accurate syntax.
- Implement the program in another language.
- Accept input from standard input if no arguments are provided.

## Submission
- Submit through your Git repository.
- Include the required files (Makefile, source files).
- Follow project norms and verify file names before submission.
